## ðŸ“š Organization Overview

[**AnkiDroid**](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) is an Android application for [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki), a powerful flashcard program that aids in learning and memorizing various topics through spaced repition and has been proven an effective tool in multiple peer-reviewed studies.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goal**
My work focused on enhancing the user experience of AnkiDroid on larger devices like tablets and Chromebooks. The project aimed to improve usability, readability, and overall aesthetics, ensuring AnkiDroid remains intuitive and efficient across a wider range of devices and introduce a more desktop-esque UX to more effectively use the larger screen real estate.

### 3. **Add Previewer to NoteEditor**

Introduces a dual-pane layout for the Note Editor, integrating a live previewer. Users will be able to edit notes while simultaneously seeing a real-time preview of the generated cards. This change consisteted of many smaller steps including splintering the note editor into a seperate fragment and activity, and creating a interface for the noteeditor to send information on changes to the previewer.

## ðŸ’¡ Outcome
This project successfully improved the accessibility and user experience of AnkiDroid on large screens. By introducing resizable dual-pane layouts and enhancing mouse support with features like right-click menus, the app now provides a more intuitive and efficient interface for tablet and Chromebook users. This work lays a strong foundation for AnkiDroid's continued evolution on large-screen devices.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Work
A key next step is the expansion of bounding box functionality. This is a planned addition to the Note Editor and all dual-fragment screens, which will force the panes to collapse back into a single-pane activity when a certain screen size threshold is met. This will ensure a more fluid and responsive experience for users who frequently resize or re-orient their devices. I also plan to add right-click context menus to more screens to further enhance large-screen usability.
